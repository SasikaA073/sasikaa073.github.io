`iCliQ` is a a wearable clicker for public speakers and other professionals, developed by our team `Comany of Noobs` for the EN1190 : Engineering Design Project module in Semester 2 at the Electronic and Telecom. Engineering - University of Moratuwa.

All the design files (Altium and Solidworks files), code, documentation, user manual is available in [github repository](https://github.com/SasikaA073/EDP-iCliq-program)

This project provided us with a great opportunity to engage in different stages of electronic product development from ideation, prototyping to commercialization. In this journey we had to learn many aspects of product design regarding idea validation, market analysis and many more. Also we acquired many technical skills such as PCB designing, enclosure designing, embedded UI designing and prototyping. 

### ðŸ”† iCliQ

iCliQ is a novel wearable clicker powered by ESP32 WROOM SoC featuring;

### ðŸ”† Identified Issue:

Both professional and amateur speakers often face challenges when it comes to managing their time during speeches or presentations, regardless of whether they are delivering a short-prepared speech or a long impromptu speech or pitching a presentation. Short-prepared speeches can be particularly challenging, as speakers may have difficulty staying on schedule without the aid of time cards or a clock. Additionally, for longer speeches such as keynotes or lectures, it's crucial to adhere to specific timing to keep the audience engaged and prevent the presentation from becoming boring.

### ðŸ”† Hardware Specifications:

- ESP32
- OLED display
- Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) 4.2
- Surface-mount device (SMD) soldering

### ðŸ”† Software Tools Used :

- Altium
- SolidWorks
- VS Code

### ðŸ”† Future Scope:

- Research and Development in to provide more accessibility features for users with special needs to help them become better public speakers.

- Applying for industrial design.

- We have already applied for a short-term fund from "AHEAD" program of World Bank through UBLC to manufacture a small batch for testing and pilot projects.
