## 🌐 [Github repo](https://github.com/SasikaA073/twitter-post-bot-m)
This Twitter bot is designed to fetch quotes from an API, retrieve images from a stock image site, process the image, and post it to Twitter. The bot is written in Python using the Selenium library, and is capable of tweeting at specific intervals over a duration of time.

Here is my Twitter automated profile that I maintained using this twitter bot.
