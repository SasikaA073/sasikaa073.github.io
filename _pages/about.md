<div class="magic">On a mission to change how camera see the world
</div>

I am a 2nd year Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering undergraduate of [University of Moratuwa](https://uom.lk).My research interests are **Computational Photography** and **Computer Vision**.

During my free time, I like to go for photowalks and hiking. I regularly post my photos in my photography portfolio. You can find them [here](https://instagram.com/random_captures_of_my_life)

I also currently serve as the Assistant Webmaster in [IEEE Signal Processing Society - University of Moratuwa Student Chapter](https://edu.ieee.org/lk-uomsps/).
